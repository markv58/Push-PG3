# Disclaimer.

This software runs on a NodeServer. It is possible that the NodeServer could fail and push notifications would stop.

Use caution when using this software. A secondary notification setup may be warranted for emergencies and potentially 
damaging conditions that might arise. ISY provides for notifications through the Networking Module using Network Resources
which should be used for serious conditions such and fire, carbon monoxide alarms, and water leaks in addition to other notifications
you might receive from devices such as the Nest Protect.

To disable the message in the Push Node, add KEY disclaimer_read VALUE true in the Custom Configurations Parameters.
